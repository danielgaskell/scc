# SymbOS C Compiler

A C compiler for [SymbOS](http://symbos.org) based on Alan Cox's Fuzix Compiler Kit
(Z80 version). SCC currently runs on Windows and Linux and cross-compiles binaries
for SymbOS, but can also cross-compile itself to run natively (albeit slowly) on SymbOS.

[Documentation and quickstart guide](doc/index.md)

SCC features:

* Full ANSI C compiler
* A proper libc port for plug-and-play compilation of existing code
* Extensive wrappers and utility functions for SymbOS system calls
* Extensive [documentation](doc/index.md) to help you get started with SymbOS programming
* Multithreading (yes, [really](doc/s_task.md#multithreading)!)
* A complete sample application (programmer's calculator) for reference

SCC is considered stable and can be used to write both console and graphical
applications without issue, but is still under active development, so you may
encounter bugs or incompletely-implemented advanced features. Please report bugs
on the Issues tab---although of course make sure that the bug is actually in the
compiler, not in your own code, and include code to reproduce it.
