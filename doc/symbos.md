## Console applications

For the most part, console applications meant to run in SymShell can be written in normal C style using the functions in `stdio.h` (`printf()`, `fgets()`, etc.). No additional headers are necessary:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    printf("Hello world!\n");
}
```

The only subtlety is that SymbOS expects console applications to have the file extension `.com` rather than `.exe`. We can rename the executable file after compilation, or tell `cc` to use a custom output name:

```bash
cc -o condemo.com condemo.c
```

While SCC's `stdio` functions are meant to work relatively seamlessly in SymShell, they are somewhat slow and bulky and are not entirely optimized for SymShell's display model. When writing code from scratch for SymbOS, consider designing it around the [system shell functions](s_shell.md#shell-functions) (`Shell_StringOut()`, `Shell_CharIn()`, etc.) rather than the standard `stdio` functions.

## Windowed applications

Writing windowed applications in SCC is not inherently difficult, but requires a thorough knowledge of SymbOS's desktop model. SCC provides the necessary headers and data types to interact with the SymbOS desktop manager, but there are no shortcuts here; writing a windowed application requires careful coding, testing, and regularly cross-referencing the documentation to ensure that every byte is where it needs to be. The most important data structures and functions are summarized here, but you may also find it useful to consult the [SymbOS developer documentation](https://symbos.org/download.htm).

This section has a lot to take in, but don't worry! To keep you from getting overwhelmed, a good place to start is to try compiling `windemo.c` (in the `sample` folder). Then, read through this section with the goal of learning what each line in `windemo.c` actually does. Once you understand it, you can use the code in `windemo.c` as a skeleton for building your own graphical application, referring to this documentation as needed to see how SymbOS handles the controls and events you want to add. Once you understand the basic concepts of segments, data structures, and messaging, writing windowed applications isn't actually that hard.

(If you want a more Visual Basic-like experience with a graphical form editor, try the useful---if quirky---[Quigs](https://symbos.org/quigs.htm) language.)

The first thing `windemo.c` does is include the header file `symbos.h`, which defines many of the features referenced in the following sections:

```c
#include <symbos.h>
```

### Memory segments

A SymbOS executable is divided into three memory segments. For console apps written with normal libc functionality, it is not generally necessary to think about this, but many SymbOS system calls make important distinctions between memory segments:

1. **Code**: Contains code and globals (unless manually placed into a different segment---see below). Can contain up to 64KB of code and data.
2. **Data**: Stores data that must not cross a 16KB page boundary. This is required by many system functions, particularly those dealing with text or image data, so SCC places string literals in this segment by default. Can contain up to 16KB of data.
3. **Transfer**: Stores data that must be relocated to the upper 16KB of address space so it can be accessed by (mainly) the desktop manager. Most data structures relating to desktop windows and controls should be placed here. Can contain up to 16KB of data.

Globals are placed in the **code** segment by default, but we can manually assign a global to the **data** or **transfer** segments by adding `_data` or `_transfer` to its declaration:

```c
_transfer char imgdata[256];
```

Many system calls also make important distinctions between memory *banks*. Because the Z80 can only address 64KB of memory at a time, extended memory (up to 1MB) is divided into multiple "banks" of 64KB each. We do not generally need to worry about this because all three segments of the executable will be loaded into the same bank. However, there are two exceptions:

1. Some system calls will need to know which bank an address is in. In most cases, this is just the application's main bank (stored in the `_symbank` global).
2. If we need to handle more than 64KB of data in our application, it is possible to [reserve and indirectly address](s_core.md#memory-management) memory in other banks.

### Windows

SymbOS defines windows and controls using carefully structured data, which must typically be located in the **transfer** segment. To make it easier to define and reference these data structures, `symbos.h` defines a set of struct types that give convenient member names to the different components. Defining a window consists of carefully defining and arranging the necessary structs in the **transfer** segment.

The format of a window's primary data structure is as follows (see also `symbos.h`):

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned char state;    // (see below)
    unsigned short flags;   // (see below)
    unsigned char pid;      // process ID of owner (set by Win_Open)
    unsigned short x;       // window X position
    unsigned short y;       // window Y position
    unsigned short w;       // window width
    unsigned short h;       // window height
    unsigned short xscroll; // X offset of window content
    unsigned short yscroll; // Y offset of window content
    unsigned short wfull;   // full width of window content
    unsigned short hfull;   // full height of window content
    unsigned short wmin;    // minimum width of window
    unsigned short hmin;    // minimum height of window
    unsigned short wmax;    // maximum width of window
    unsigned short hmax;    // maximum height of window
    char* icon;             // address of the 8x8 window icon, in SGX format
    char* title;            // address of the title text
    char* status;           // address of the status text
    void* menu;             // address of the Menu struct (see Menus)
    void* controls;         // address of the control group struct
    void* toolbar;          // address of the control group struct for the toolbar
    unsigned short toolheight; // toolbar height, in pixels
    char reserved1[9];
    unsigned char modal;    // modal window ID + 1
    char reserved2[140];
} Window;
```

Some commentary on these elements is useful.

`state` is one of the following: `WIN_CLOSED`, `WIN_NORMAL`, `WIN_MAXIMIZED`, or `WIN_MINIMIZED`.

`flags` is an OR'd bitmask which may contain one or more of the following flags:

* `WIN_ICON` = show window icon
* `WIN_RESIZABLE` = window can be resized
* `WIN_CLOSE` = show close button
* `WIN_TOOLBAR` = show toolbar
* `WIN_TITLE` = show titlebar
* `WIN_MENU` = show menubar
* `WIN_STATUS` = show statusbar
* `WIN_ADJUSTX` = disable horizontal slider in resizable windows (i.e., the program will adjust its own X scroll, not the system)
* `WIN_ADJUSTY` = disable vertical slider in resizable windows (i.e., the program will adjust its own Y scroll, not the system)
* `WIN_NOTTASKBAR` = do not display in taskbar
* `WIN_NOTMOVEABLE` = window cannot be moved
* `WIN_MODAL` = modal window ([see below](#modal-windows))

For windows that have the `WIN_RESIZABLE` flag, there is an important distinction between the size of the *window* (given by `.w` and `.h`) and the size of its *content* (given by `.wfull` and `.hfull`). The window will have scroll bars at the edges, and if the size of the window is smaller than the size of the content, the user will be able to use these scroll bars to move around and view the whole content of the window. This can be used to accomplish a variety of interesting techniques by adjusting the content of the window in response to the user scrolling or resizing the window; see [resizing calculations](#resizing-calculations) for some discussion of this.

The window icon is an 8x8 4-color SGX image. The `.icon` member can be set to 0 if there is no icon, but this will also prevent the window from being displayed correctly in the taskbar. Images can be converted to SGX format using software such as [MSX Viewer 5](https://marmsx.msxall.com/msxvw/msxvw5/index_en.php) (classic version) or the `gfx2sgx` tool shipped as part of SCC's [graphics library](graphics.md), and their raw data examined using a hex editor. A simple default icon is:

```c
_transfer char icon[19] = {0x02, 0x08, 0x08, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xF8, 0xF1, 0xF8, 0xF1,
                           0x8F, 0x1F, 0x8F, 0x1F, 0x8F, 0x1F, 0x8F, 0x1F, 0xFF, 0xFF};
```

The content of the window data structure can be defined using a static initializer. Note that SCC does not currently support named initializers such as `.x = 10`, so we will instead need to list all necessary elements in order, being careful not to omit any intervening elements. Here's an example window definition:

```c
_transfer Window form1 = {
    WIN_NORMAL,
    WIN_CLOSE | WIN_TITLE | WIN_ICON,
    0,          // PID
    10, 10,     // x, y
    178, 110,   // w, h
    0, 0,       // xscroll, yscroll
    178, 110,   // wfull, hfull
    178, 110,   // wmin, hmin
    178, 110,   // wmax, hmax
    icon,       // icon
    "Form 1",   // title text
    0,          // no status text
    0,          // no menu
    &ctrls};    // controls
```

(The line `&ctrls` will be explained in the next section.)

### Controls

Window controls (buttons, text, etc.) are defined using `Ctrl` structs, which must themselves be linked to an overarching `Ctrl_Group` struct. The definition of a `Ctrl_Group` struct is:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned char controls;   // total number of controls in the group
    unsigned char pid;        // process ID of owner (set by Win_Open for main group)
    void* first;              // address of first control's data
    void* calcrule;           // address of first resizing calculation (see below), or 0 for none
    unsigned short unused1;
    unsigned char retctrl;    // control ID to "click" on pressing Return
    unsigned char escctrl;    // control ID to "click" on pressing Escape
    char reserved1[4];
    unsigned char focusctrl;  // control ID to select on window focus
    unsigned char reserved2;
} Ctrl_Group;
```

Each control is an instance of the struct `Ctrl`, which has the definition:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned short value; // control ID or return value
    unsigned char type;   // control type
    char bank;            // bank of extended data record (-1 for default)
    unsigned short param; // parameter, or address of extended data record
    unsigned short x;     // X location relative to window content
    unsigned short y;     // Y location relative to window content
    unsigned short w;     // width in pixels
    unsigned short h;     // height in pixels
    unsigned short unused;
} Ctrl;
```

The controls in a control group must be defined in order immediately after each other, with the encompassing `Ctrl_Group.first` pointing to the address of the first control. (This will also be the order in which they are drawn onscreen.)

The member `.param` requires some explanation. For the simplest type of control, it is simply a 16-bit number containing various values and flags required by the control. For instance, an important control type is `C_AREA`, which fills the control's area with a solid color; in this case `.param` is the color code (e.g., `COLOR_BLACK`, `COLOR_RED`, `COLOR_ORANGE` or `COLOR_YELLOW` in the default Amstrad CPC 4-color mode). This control is very important because SymbOS will not fill the window background automatically! Starting the main control group with a `C_AREA` control ensures that the window background is filled in.

For more complicated control types, `.param` holds the address of the control's extended data record. (Note that we will need to cast this address to `(unsigned short)` or a compatible type for SCC to accept it, since SCC does not normally allow assigning a pointer directly to a scalar variable.) Each control type has a different extended data record format. For example, to declare a text label, we would use `Ctrl_Text`:

```c
typedef struct {
    char* text;          // address of text string
    unsigned char color; // (foreground << 2) | background
    unsigned char flags; // ALIGN_LEFT, ALIGN_CENTER, or ALIGN_RIGHT
} Ctrl_Text;
```

Combining this into a set of controls for our example window:

```c
// extended data record for c_text1
_transfer Ctrl_Text cd_text1 = {
    "Hello world!",                    // text
    (COLOR_BLACK << 2) | COLOR_ORANGE, // color
    ALIGN_LEFT};                       // flags

// two controls, immediately after each other
_transfer Ctrl c_area = {
    0, C_AREA, -1,             // control ID, type, bank
    COLOR_ORANGE,              // param (color)
    0, 0,                      // x, y
    10000, 10000};             // width, height
_transfer Ctrl c_text1 = {
    0, C_TEXT, -1,             // control ID, type, bank
    (unsigned short)&cd_text1, // param (extended data record)
    20, 10,                    // x, y
    100, 8};                   // width, height

// control group
_transfer Ctrl_Group ctrls = {
    2, 0,                      // number of controls, process ID
    &c_area};                  // address of first control
```

### Desktop commands

To display a window, we need to tell the desktop manager to open it. `symbos.h` provides many helper functions for managing windows (see the [system call reference](s_window.md#window-management)); the first one we need is `Win_Open()`:

```c
char Win_Open(char bank, void* addr);
```

This opens the window defined at address `addr` in memory bank `bank`, and returns a window ID that will be needed to identify the window in subsequent commands. Usually, this is the main bank the application is running in, which can be found in the global variable `_symbank`. So, to open the window we defined earlier:

```c
char winID;
winID = Win_Open(_symbank, &form1);
```

Another important call is `Win_Close()`, which closes an open window (windows will also be closed automatically on app exit):

```c
void Win_Close(char winID);
```

The last really important call is `Win_Redraw()`, which redraws a portion of the window content. SymbOS will not automatically redraw the window after we change something (for instance, changing the text of a button), so we need to do it manually:

```c
void Win_Redraw(unsigned char winID, signed char what, unsigned char first);
```

Here, `what` can be either (1) -1, meaning "redraw entire window content"; (2) the control ID of a single control to redraw; or (3) a negative number (from -2 to -16) indicating how many controls should be redrawn (from 2 to 16), in which case `first` indicates the control ID of the first control to redraw. (There are separate commands for redrawing the menu, toolbar, titlebar, and statusbar; see the [system call reference](s_window.md#window-management).)

### Handling events

SymbOS apps communicate with the desktop manager via interprocess messages. `symbos.h` provides helper functions that handle most of the necessary messages automatically (as with `Win_Open()` above). However, we still need to understand how messaging works internally in order to set up the main loop that will receive event notifications from the desktop manager.

Messages are passed via a small buffer which must be placed in the **transfer** segment. The standard message buffer in SCC is `_symmsg`, which is suitable for most tasks:

```c
char _symmsg[14];
```

The core functions for sending and receiving messages are:

```c
unsigned char Msg_Send(char rec_pid, char send_pid, char* msg);
unsigned short Msg_Receive(char rec_pid, char send_pid, char* msg);
unsigned short Msg_Sleep(char rec_pid, char send_pid, char* msg);
```

* `Msg_Send()` sends the message in the buffer `*msg` to the process ID `send_pid`. 
* `Msg_Receive()` checks whether the process ID `send_pid` has sent us a message, and if so, places it in the buffer `*msg`.
* `Msg_Sleep()` is similar to `Msg_Receive()`, but if there is no message, it will sleep, releasing CPU time back to SymbOS until such a message arrives.

In each case `rec_pid` is the "inbound" process ID that should receive the response (that is, our own process ID, which can be found in the global variable `_sympid`). The process ID of the desktop manager is always 2, but to receive messages from any process, we can use -1.

After opening our starting window, we need to go into a loop that:

1. Calls `Msg_Sleep()` to wait for a message;
2. Checks the message type in the first byte, `msg[0]`; and
3. Takes any necessary action.

Message type codes are documented in the [event reference](s_event.md). The most immediately useful message is `MSR_DSK_WCLICK`, which is sent for most interactions with a window or form. The return message then has the format:

* `msg[0]`: `MSR_DSK_WCLICK`
* `msg[1]`: Window ID
* `msg[2]`: Action type, one of:
    * `DSK_ACT_CLOSE`: Close button has been clicked, or the user has typed Alt+F4.
    * `DSK_ACT_MENU`: A menu option has been clicked, with:
        * `msg[8]` = Value of the clicked menu entry
    * `DSK_ACT_CONTENT` = A control has been clicked or modified, with:
        * `msg[3]`: Sub-action, one of:
            * `DSK_SUB_MLCLICK`: Left mouse button clicked
            * `DSK_SUB_MRCLICK`: Right mouse button clicked
            * `DSK_SUB_MDCLICK`: Left mouse button double clicked
            * `DSK_SUB_MMCLICK`: Middle mouse button clicked
            * `DSK_SUB_KEY`: Key pressed, with key ASCII value in `msg[4]`
        * `*(int*)&msg[4]` = Mouse X position relative to window content
        * `*(int*)&msg[6]` = Mouse y position relative to window content
        * `msg[8]` = control ID
    * `DSK_ACT_TOOLBAR`: Equivalent to `DSK_ACT_CONTENT`, but for controls in the toolbar.
    * `DSK_ACT_KEY`: A key has been pressed without modifying any control:
        * `msg[4]` = key ASCII value

Putting this all together, an example of a skeleton main loop is below. This opens our previously-defined window `form1` and loops, waiting for an event. In this example, the only event implemented is the most important one: exiting the application when the user tries to close the window!

```c
char winID;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    winID = Win_Open(_symbank, &form1);
    
    while (1) {
        // handle events
        _symmsg[0] = 0;
        Msg_Sleep(_sympid, -1, _symmsg);
        if (_symmsg[0] == MSR_DSK_WCLICK) {
            switch (_symmsg[2]) {
                case DSK_ACT_CLOSE: // Alt+F4 or click close
                    exit();
                // more event cases go here...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

That's it, our first windowed application! (The complete code for this demo is available as `windemo.c` in the `samples` folder.) Everything else we might want to do---more controls, more windows, more interactivity---can be accomplished by adding more data records and event-handling code to this skeleton.

## Next steps

Complete references to all available controls, event messages, and system calls are available in the following sections:

* [Control reference](s_ctrl.md)
* [Event reference](s_event.md)
* [System call reference](syscalls.md)

Information about advanced window features (menus, toolbars, etc.) is available in the following section.

## Advanced windows

### Menus

Compared to lists (see `C_LISTBOX`), menus are comparatively simple. We define a menu using a `Menu` struct directly followed by a series of `Menu_Entry` structs:

```c
typedef struct {
    unsigned short entries;  // number of Menu_Entry structs to follow
} Menu;

typedef struct {
    unsigned short flags;    // flags (see below)
    char* text;              // address of entry text
    unsigned short value;    // value to return when clicked, or address of submenu
    unsigned short unused;
} Menu_Entry;
```

`flags` is an OR'd bitmask that may consist of one or more of the following flags:

* `MENU_ACTIVE`: entry is active and can be clicked (we usually want this).
* `MENU_CHECKED`: entry has a checkmark. Note that `MENU_CHECKED` will not be updated automatically---it is our responsibility to receive menu events and take the necessary action, such as toggling the `MENU_CHECKED` flag for a given entry.
* `MENU_SUBMENU`: entry opens a submenu. If `MENU_SUBMENU` is set, `value` points to the `Menu` struct defining the submenu to open. Submenus can be nested up to 5 levels deep.
* `MENU_SEPARATOR`: entry is a separator line.
* `MENU_ICON`: entry begins with an icon (SymbOS 4.0 and up only, and only allowed in drop-down menus, not a window's top-level menu bar.) If `MENU_ICON` is set, the entry's `text` string must begin with a five-byte inline image [control code](#c_text_ctrl) representing an 8x8 icon that will be plotted before the entry. (i.e., `0x06` `0x80` `banknum` `[canvas](graphics.md#graphics-library) address - 1`).

Windows can have main menus if their `WIN_MENU` flag is set and their `menu` property points to a `Menu` struct similar to the above. Menus can also be opened independently (see the [Menu_Context()](s_desk.md#menu_context) system call).

```c
// example
_transfer Menu submenu = {2};
_transfer Menu_Entry submenu_row1 = {MENU_ACTIVE, "Entry 1", 1};
_transfer Menu_Entry submenu_row2 = {MENU_ACTIVE, "Entry 2", 2};

_transfer Menu mainmenu = {3};
_transfer Menu_Entry mainmenu_row1 = {MENU_ACTIVE | MENU_SUBMENU, "Submenu", (unsigned short)&submenu};
_transfer Menu_Entry mainmenu_row2 = {MENU_ACTIVE | MENU_CHECKED, "Option", 3};
_transfer Menu_Entry mainmenu_row3 = {0, "Inactive", 4};
```

### Toolbars

Windows can have a separate "toolbar" region if their property `.toolheight` is greater than 0. This specifies the vertical height (in pixels) of the toolbar region, which will be plotted just below the titlebar or menubar (if present). This region is distinct from the window content in two ways: it does not scroll with the window content in a resizable window, and it has a separate control group data record.

The control group data record for a toolbar is structurally identical to the main control group data record for a window (including the need for a `C_AREA` control to fill in the background of the toolbar), but it is registered in the window's `.toolbar` property instead of its `.controls` property. Refreshing the toolbar must be done with `Win_Redraw_Toolbar` instead of `Win_Redraw`, and user events will be passed back with the `DSK_ACT_TOOLBAR` type instead of the `DSK_ACT_CONTENT` type.

### Resizing calculations

The default behavior of resizable windows is to show only a portion of the main window content (optionally with scrollbars to allow the user to scroll to the rest of the content). However, we can also tell the desktop manager to automatically move and resize the controls on a window using "calculation rules." Calculation rules are defined by a series of `Calc_Rule` structs, one struct per control in the window's main control group, with the format:

```c
typedef struct {
    signed short xbase; // x base
    unsigned char xmult;  // x multiplier
    unsigned char xdiv;   // x divisor
    signed short ybase; // y base
    unsigned char ymult;  // y multiplier
    unsigned char ydiv;   // y divisor
    signed short wbase; // width base
    unsigned char wmult;  // width multiplier
    unsigned char wdiv;   // width divisor
    signed short hbase; // height base
    unsigned char hmult;  // height multiplier
    unsigned char hdiv;   // height divisor
} Calc_Rule;
```

The calculation rules for a control group should be placed immediately after one another in the **transfer** segment, one `Calc_Rule` per control, and the `calcrule` property of the window's main `Ctrl_Group` set to the address of the first `Calc_Rule`. When the window is resized, the `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h` properties of each `Ctrl` in the window's main `Ctrl_Group` will be automatically recalculated according to the formula:

* `x` = `xbase` + (window_width * `xmult` / `xdiv`)
* `y` = `ybase` + (window_height * `ymult` / `ydiv`)
* `w` = `wbase` + (window_width * `wmult` / `wdiv`)
* `h` = `hbase` + (window_height * `hmult` / `hdiv`)

An easy way to think about these formulas is in terms of which control margins you want to remain a constant distance from the corresponding side of the window area:

* To keep a control's left margin constant, use `xbase` = left_margin, `xmult` = 0, `xdiv` = 1.
* To keep a control's right margin constant, use `xbase` = -(control_width + right_margin), `xmult` = 1, `xdiv` = 1.
* To keep both left and right margins constant, stretching the control to fit, use `xbase` = left_margin, `xmult` = 0, `xdiv` = 1, `wbase` = -(left_margin + right_margin), `wmult` = 1, `wdiv` = 1.
* To keep a control's top margin constant, use `ybase` = top_margin, `ymult` = 0, `ydiv` = 1.
* To keep a control's bottom margin constant, use `ybase` = -(control_height + bottom_margin), `ymult` = 1, `ydiv` = 1.
* To keep both top and bottom margins constant, stretching the control to fit, use `ybase` = top_margin, `ymult` = 0, `ydiv` = 1, `hbase` = -(top_margin + bottom_margin), `hmult` = 1, `hdiv` = 1.

For example, to resize a single control to fill the entirety of the window content except for a 12-pixel area at the top of the window content (left margin = 0, right margin = 0, top margin = 12, bottom margin = 0):

```c
_transfer Calc_Rule calcrule = {0, 0, 1, 12, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, -12, 1, 1};
```

When using calculation rules, we should be careful about setting the maximum and minimum window sizes in the `Window` record to sizes where we know the calculations will be valid. For example, if we have a control with a left margin of 25 and a right margin of 100 and we let the user resize the window to only 50 pixels wide, the calculated width of the control will be negative! We can avoid this situation by defining an appropriate minimum width, such as 150.

(An alternative approach is to recognize the "window resized" event `MSR_DSK_WRESIZ`, manually recalculate the `x`, `y`, `w`, and `h` properties of the affected controls, and redraw any controls that have moved or been resized by this calculation. However, using calculation rules will result in a smoother experience because the desktop manager can recalculate controls as the window is being resized, rather than redrawing them twice.)

### Modal windows

Windows can be "modal", that is, unable to be focused or interacted with as long as another window (here called the "topmost" window) is open. To establish a modal relationship, we need to set two values:

* Set the `WIN_MODAL` flag for the topmost window, i.e.: `form2.flags |= WIN_MODAL`.
* Set the `.modal` property of the lower window to the window ID of the topmost window, plus 1, i.e.: `form1.modal = form1id + 1`.

When the topmost window closes, unset both properties. If the user clicks the lower window while this relationship has been established, the deskop manager sends a `MSR_DSK_WMODAL` message to notify the application. (This is particularly useful to create dialogs that should be closed automatically if the user clicks the main window.)
